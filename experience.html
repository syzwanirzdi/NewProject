		<h1 style="text-decoration: underline; text-align: center;">MY LIFE EXPERIENCE</h1>
		<ol style="font-size: 20px;">
			<li><b>Active in association activities</b><br />
			During my primary and secondary school days, I never participated in association activities because my school was less focused on co-curriculum. Nevertheless, I have joined the Knights Commander and am active in the activities of the association. Every week there is only one event organized by my association.
			<br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>Working as a babysitter</b><br />
			Once I finished high school, I kept looking for a job because I wanted money for myself. In fact, I also want the experience. So, I got a job taking care of the kids. I had to feed them, put them to bed and more.
			<br /><br /></li>
			<li><b>Play frisbee</b><br />
			If you want to know, I really don't like sports but since I know the game of frisbee, I fell in love and love to play with it every evening. The reason I like to play frisbee is that many of my friends play the sport and they like to invite me to play once.
